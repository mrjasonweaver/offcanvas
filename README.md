# OffCanvas
  
## A Multi-Device Web Layout Pattern
Inspired by the [observations](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514) of [Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com), this Off Canvas layout demo has 3 panels that display differently depending on the viewport width. The idea here is to have the two supporting panels of navigation and sidebar content hidden just off-screen to the left and right for easy access on small/medium viewports. Off Canvas is a design pattern, not a plugin or framework.
